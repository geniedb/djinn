https://github.com/geniedb/djinn

An IRC bot that brings trac to IRC,
djinn was written by Andy Bennett <andyjpb@geniedb.com>


Setup & Configuration
=====================

You will probably want to edit djinn.py to set the following variables:

	HOST: Set this to the hostname of the IRC server you wish djinn to
	      connect to.

	NICK: Set this to the IRC nick that you wish djinn to use.

	CHAN: Set this to the IRC channel that you wish djinn to join.

	TRAC_TICKETS: Set this to the URL of the ticket section of your trac
	              installation. You can find this out by viewing one of your
		      trac tickets in your browser and then removing the last
		      portion, including the slash. For example, if your ticket
		      has a URL thusly:

		      http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/886

		      Then TRAC_TICKETS should be:

		      http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket


Invocation & Installation
=========================

You can start djinn from the command line either like this:

	./djinn.py

...or like this:

	python djinn.py


At GenieDB we copied djinn.py to /usr/local/bin, set up a specific user for
djinn to run as and put the following in /etc/rc.local:

	su - djinn -s /bin/bash -c 'nohup /usr/local/bin/djinn.py >/dev/null 2>&1 &'
